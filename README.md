What is VESTX?
----------------

VESTX is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. VESTX uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. VESTX is based on the codebase of XSN (Stakenet).
